        <p>Thinking, Fast and Slow is a 2011 popular science book by psychologist Daniel Kahneman. The book's main
            thesis is a differentiation between two modes of thought: "System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional;
            "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.

            The book delineates rational and non-rational motivations or triggers associated with each type of thinking
            process, and how they complement each other, starting with Kahneman's own research on loss aversion. From
            framing choices to people's tendency to replace a difficult question with one which is easy to answer, the
            book summarizes several decades of research to suggest that people have too much confidence in human
            judgment.Kahneman performed his own research, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky, which enriched his
            experience to write the book.It covers different phases of his career: his early work concerning cognitive
            biases, his work on prospect theory and happiness, and with the Israel Defense Forces.<br>

            The book was a New York Times bestseller and was the 2012 winner of the National Academies Communication
            Award for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics in behavioral science,
            engineering and medicine.The integrity of some priming studies cited in the book has been called into
            question in the midst of the psychological replication crisis.
