        <p>The Bhagavadgita is an episode recorded in the Mahabharata, a Sanskrit epic poem of ancient India. It is an
            influential religious text in Hinduism that takes the form of a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Krishna,
            an avatar of the Hindu deity Vishnu. It was likely composed in the 1st or 2nd century CE
            The Bhagavad Gita is one of the holiest books of Hinduism.The Bhagavad Gita (romanized: bhagavad-gītā,
            lit.'The Song by God'), often referred to as the Gita (IAST: gītā), is part of the ancient Hindu epic
            Mahabharata. It is considered to be written in the first millennium BCE. It has teachings said to be given
            by Sri Krishna, who is considered a Supreme divine being. In the book (Bhagvat Gita), Krishna answers
            questions from Arjuna, a Pandava prince, about a human's moral duties (called dharma) regarding a broad
            range of philosophical and metaphysical matters.

            The Bhagavad Gita is set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between the Pandava prince Arjuna and his
            charioteer guide , Krishna. At the start of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and their cousins,
            Kauravas, Prince Arjuna is in doubt, thinking about the violence the war will cause.Wondering if he should
            renounce the war, Arjuna seeks the counsel of Krishna, whose answers and their discourse constitute the
            Bhagavad Gita. Krishna counsels Arjuna to "fulfill his warrior duty" for the upholding of dharma.The
            Krishna–Arjuna dialogue covers a broad range of spiritual topics, touching upon moral and ethical dilemmas,
            and philosophical issues that go far beyond the war that Arjuna faces.
